    whoAmIText: `Hello! I'm Victor Hugo, I'm 16 years old and a Front-End Developer, based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.\nSince a young age, my admiration for technology has been clear. In 2020, I entered the world of programming and, using Java Bukkit, I created plugins for Minecraft game servers. In the same year, I started building bots for the Discord platform, using Javascript. However, in 2021, due to unexpected issues with bot development, I decided to focus on Front-End. Since then, I have been dedicating myself to learning and improving my skills in building dynamic and functional interfaces.`
